Mention how to install the setup and run the program in the readme, i.e. install xampp etc.
Make readme clear with correct markdown. Properly format it and make it look appealing to a user.
Make file names correct (success, sucess2,temp). These file names don't really suggest anything. Name them more sensibly. Checkout out other projects on GitHub and see how files are names.
There are a lot of spelling mistakes in files names
There are a lot of non-preferable errors when logged in as a different user
